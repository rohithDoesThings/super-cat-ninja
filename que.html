                Hey Nithya, Been a while, I really want to talk to you, but atleast hear me out
            </p>
            <p>Things happened and it wasnt cool but it made me understand how much you mean to me, im kinda glad it happened because id have never know how important you are to me if we didnt have this break.</p>
            I just dont see myself doing things like these to anyone else- you know what i mean? i dont see myself asking someone to forgive me and shit or getting on knees for them, i mean if there's one person id do things like these it is def you. Dark days took me over and changed me and i dont feel love or anything towards anyone anymore unless they're named as nithyasri aka sona... <p>
        
        <p>
            Back then i panicked but everthing's settled, im feeling amazing and my mind's all clear, i fixed myself first and i wanted to just have this convo with you.
        </p>
            </p>I put you thro a lot but trust me i never wanted things to go bad like this, sorry about that whole week i was not in my sense tbh...i tried to be good but i fell off the wagon big time, but trust me ive been loyal to you when u were with me and even when u werent around i never went on a date, i made many friends but never touched another girl, you mean alot to me and no one can even come close to how much you mean<p></p> <p>

        </p>I'd literally stop doing everything and id run many miles just to see you again, day and night ive sat there waiting for ur reply, sometimes im slowly tryna let you go for my own good but deep down i just know that things aint done and not a single day went by where i didnt think about you...
        <p>

            <p>I miss those unplanned meet ups, i miss your stories, your perfume, i miss those bike rides and i really want you to say hello to my new pets they are so lovely, i miss hearing about your friends, jyo, sru all of them i really wanna hangout and chill like the other day</p>
            
        </p>I genuine want to have this talk with you, i'm not sure if you'll open my msgs or my website - so you gotta excuse me in advance if i drop u a call to get ur attention, but i just wanna talk for atleast like 2mins..alot changed, people dont even recognise me thats how much ive changed by appearance and my life's been going good work wise and i will soon switch my career and yea i'll tell u more on that when we meet, and i aint some weak guy sona to you maybe i show alot of emotion but fuck everything else ik im the best guy,Something sparked within me, and ever since that moment im working my ass off, im prioritizing my looks and physique, I haven't been the same. im back to my best mindset and i would literally do anything for you, i'd defend you against the whole world id even fight a bear for you.<p>

            <p>
                <p>
                    lot of crazy things happened and i got attacked by a vanavil nanbar after posting a reel on my ig, stupid dumb fuck things happened but when your best friend aint around it to see those aint really legendary right? I wanna tell you all the stories and also i wanna listen to yours, how many events did you win recently, how's it all going, and you got an iphone ig? i wanna know what youve been upto recently, come onnn sonaaa solluuu im pretty sure you did alot of things ......
                </p>
            </p>
        </p>We have went out for almost 5 months and out of those 5 months we have had only one big fight, and its all on me. Im tryna be a stronger man and fix things..if you get some time around feb month feel free to come and see me, its totally upto you so. <p>
        <p>So at chai shop near eekatuthangal, place where we met after u won that trophy remember? the one with good puffs ? there you'll see a tall guy with long hair, wearing a dark blue jacket, and he's probably got the BIGGEST CRUSH ON YOU and you are the favorite cat to him, he'll be sitting and having a tea, ya shud probably go say hi~( I'll tell him not to hug and crush ya w big hugs dw) 7.30 to 8.30 I'll be there for you, date ~ Feb 14, 2024, Wednesday ig.
            <p>

            </p> I wont expect you to be all chill maybe u wont show up i got nothing against you bc youre as perfect as the nature, ik you are so angry, be mad at me, stay mad,grab me by my shirt and hit me im all yours but let me fix, let me make it up to you.<p>
    <p>
        <p>
            Its not like im gonna ask you to come back to me again and date me like nothing happened also you know i would never be in anything serious, Im totally a new guy- i dont look the same, i probably might look yonger than you lol bc i got rid of my beard and i havent cut my hair ever since we last met and its like all bussu bussu nu and im socialising like a mf so yea i've swtched to a diff character, let all the good moments and the bad moments go and just look at me like im a new person because its been many many months now right. just give me the passes to call you when im drunk, i wanna call you and sing songs, I wanna give you back that varkala shirt it doesnt have ur scent on it, let me teach ya how to do nunchaks, this isnt even about dating or relationship because lets say you werent a girl, we cant date right? but yea we can be best buds right? let it be like that then ~ i just want peace and be chill and im doing alot of stupid things and when my best bud aint around to look at it, it doesnt even look funny uk.
            <p>

            </p> so i'll leave it upto you, obviously life has to move on i cant be like this forever but i just felt from my heart to write you these above paras. I'll respect your decision if you dont want anything but if you just get to know me better after this break - <p>

            </p>I promise you, I'll give you the warmest of all hugs, gentlest kisses on your hands while driving, more neck attacks, and many "more" things as romantic as possible. I'll look at you in a way no guy has ever looked at you out of love.I will give you breaks whenever you need, I'll ensure you'd feel adored as my princess, and you can absolutely do anything you want. I'll not ask you to change a thing for me because,  <p></p> SONA >>>> everyother girl.
