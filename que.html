                Hey Nithya, I know you must be so angry, I really want to talk to you, but atleast hear me out
            </p>
            
            It took me days to almost a week to do this for you and i dont see myself doing things like these to anyone else. Dark days took me over and changed me and i dont feel love or anything towards anyone anymore unless they're named as nithyasri aka sona... <p>
            </p>I put you thro a lot but trust me i never wanted things to go bad like this, sorry about that whole week i was not in my sense tbh...i tried to be good but i fell off the wagon big time, but trust me ive been loyal to you when u were with me and even when u werent around i never went felt like letting anyone replace you, you mean alot to me and no one can even come close to how much you mean<p></p> <p>

        </p>I'd literally stop doing everything and id run many miles just to see you again, day and night ive sat there waiting for ur reply, sometimes im slowly tryna let you go for my own good but deep down i just know that things aint done and not a single day went by where i didnt think about you...
        <p>

            <p>I miss those unplanned meet ups, i miss your stories, your perfume, i miss those bike rides and i really want you to say hello to my new pets, i miss hearing about your friends, jyo, sru all of them i really wanna hangout and chill like the other day</p>
            
        </p> Im back to my old senses for a long time now and i genuine want to have this talk with you, i'm not sure if you'll open my msgs or my website - so you gotta excuse me in advance if i drop u a call to get ur attention, but i just wanna talk for atleast like 2mins..I've changed both in and out, people dont even recognise me thats how much ive changed by appearance and my life's been going good work wise and im looking forward to many things, and i aint some weak guy sona to you maybe i show alot of emotion but fuck everything else ik im the best guy, I might be all tall and might know how to fight and all that but when it comes to you, i just melt completely........ <p>

        </p>We have went out for almost 5 months and out of those 5 months we have had only one big fight, and its all on me...Tears dont lie and i made a mistake but im your boi sona, I'd really do anything for you and thats one of the main reason i didnt even care if it was outdoor and i got on my knees for you, if you can spend a 2mins for me here's something for you <p>
        <p>So at chai shop near eekatuthangal, place where we met after u won that trophy remember? the one with good puffs ? there you'll see a tall guy with long hair, wearing a dark blue jacket, and he's probably got the BIGGEST CRUSH ON YOU and you are the favorite cat to him, he'll be sitting and having a tea, ya shud probably go say hi~( I'll tell him not to hug and crush ya w big hugs dw) 7.30 to 8.30 I'll be there for you, date ~ Feb 14, 2024, Wednesday ig.
            <p>

            </p> I wont expect you to be all chill, ik you are so angry, be mad at me, stay mad,grab me by my shirt and hit me im all yours but let me fix, let me make it up to you i just need 2-5 mins of your time thats all im asking...I dont have the heart to do all this to someone else and tbh i dont want to, i've got rizz filled all over my veins and hands and i cant wait to squish youu...- <p>
