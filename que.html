        <h5 style="color: black;">Ik its all over, there's nothing more i could do....It took me days to almost a week to do this for you and i dont see myself doing things like these to anyone else. Dark days took me over and changed me and i dont feel love or anything towards anyone anymore... the words inside this website was written out of love and affection i once had for you, UK i'd literally stop doing everything and id run many miles just to see you again, day and night ive sat there waiting for ur reply but its just i dont see you ever coming back so im slowly tryna let you go for my own good.. A part of me beleived that u were the one but it is what it is right?..this website is like the only thing which remains betwn us i think and i dont have the heart to change the words inside those below boxes or disable the site, Im tryna disappear and I'll try to move on.., I put you thro a lot but trust me i never wanted things to go bad like this, im learning. I hope whatever decision you made was completely made by urself since ive seen some girl bsfs are the main reasons for most breakups.. its not like im a saint or something good, i tried to be a good guy around you but i fell of the wagon big time, i do believe i have given 100 percent to you to win you back and if there's anything else i could do i would def do it for you..I wish you well.If by any chance you change your mind, i'll be at chai shop near eekatuthangal, place where we met after u won that trophy remember? the one with good puffs?...I'll be there and if any of place i'll update it here...around 7.30-8.00 evening feb 14, i'll wait till 8.30...ik nothing matters but still,here u go....To my fav cat</h5>
