                To one of the most special person ive met in my life, Your presence would really lit up anyone's day, my life was going super fast but then i met you, time slowed down like a romantic movie, I remember everything vividly, your eyebrows and the mark on it, your lil lips, the way you walk, how you look when u get mad, days with you was nothing but beautiful whenever I think about it. 
                
                <p>Thanks for being there even if it wasn't for that long, I really appreciate you for everything u did, every single message you've sent. All them phone calls and meet ups...whenever I'm gon think about this year (2023) you're definitely gonna be one of the main reasons to remember it.(2024 moye moye)
                </p>
                You're an angel with the cutest smile ever, even a man hunting demon would melt away looking at you, and totally change into a kid around you, thats what happened to me- the first moment i saw you i just knew something and yea im leaving the rest to the universe. but you dont know girl, u aint from earth, you're def from up above &#x1F5A4;
              <p> 
                <p></p>
                There can be few things special about someone but it's just everything about you is so special. You and ur silly roasting skills going up against someone almost 7yrs older than ya and roasting them....If there's a hundred girls standing on the stage, 10 would get the main attention, 5 would look almost attractive and similar to each other. In the remaining 5, three would be dickheads, but those two left— they'd be cute as hell and also have a personality that anyone would fall in love with. You are exactly that and out of those 2, 1 would be a cat like ya. I don't think there are many girls like you. May God send more sweethearts like you to Earth.
          
                    <p></p>
                </p>
                I wish I had something that belongs to you, like a souvenir. The reason I asked for that Varkala shirt was that I thought your scent would be on it bc u wore it at home. At that time, if I asked for any of your clothes, you definitely wouldn't have given me anything; you were like on fire. But yeah, it doesnt have ur scent on it......
            <p>   
                   </p> 
                
                Looking back at things, it's more like having a puppy—the most precious thing in the world. You get used to being with it, you play with it everyday but life forcingly teaches you a lesson for a mistake and separates you from precious thing you had.  
                
                    It is what it is. hit me, scold me, stop talking w me for next thousand years i'll still go awwwwuuu nu instead of being mad, cute you.  
                
<p> </p>

<p>If I could wish to experience one moment again and again with the same exact feeling, it would be when I held your hands in that metro station for the first time. I've tried weed, alcohol, and all that, but holding your hands – nothing beats that. Not the boxing fights, but holding your hands, my heart went twice as fast, pounding and this feeling of finally after all that waiting im holding the hands of the girl i had a crush on for so long and woaahh it was idek the right words, im dead bro im done that was  like a life time settlement moment.</p>
<p>
    You are a piece of Art &#x1F90D;
</p>
            <p>    anyways, the other day i gave you back those certificates, but they didnt give you the certificate for the best cat in the world. But yea you deserve one :) </p>
        </p>  
        <p> Happy bday lil cat&#x1F5A4; </p>
